# SQL & Python Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains a curated collection of SQL and Python problems 
that I find interesting across various platforms on the internet.

The goal is not just interview preparation, but structured logic building, 
query optimization practice, and strengthening problem-solving skills.

Topics Covered:
- SQL (Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Aggregations, Business Queries)
- Python (Data Structures, Algorithms, Pandas, Logic Building)

This repository reflects my continuous learning and consistency in practice.
